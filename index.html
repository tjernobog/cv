        <h1>Benjamin Thomas King</h1>
        <p><em>Computer Software Developer</em></p>
        <p>I graduate from Victoria University in 2019 with a BSc in Computer Science
          and am interested in getting into the game development field.</p>
        <p>I have been passionate about video games since I played the Commander Keen
          games in the early ’90s as a little kid. Since then I have always had a
          desire to be creative and share stories.</p>
        <p>Along with the practical skills I learn at university (papers in game
          development, UI design, computer graphics, among others), I have film making
          skills (directing, writing, camera work, etc) that I believe could be helpful
          in the video game industry.</p>
